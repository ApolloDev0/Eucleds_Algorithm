Start Program
function called euclidean that takes 2 integer arguements:
    declare an integer GCF that will be returned after the function completes
    while the two given integer values are not equal:
        check which one is larger:
            continously subtract the larger value from the smaller value till they are equal
            give GCF the value of either one of the integer end results
            exit with status 0;
    if they are equal:
        give GCF the value of either one of the integer values and return it
        exit with status 0;

call euclidean(n1,n2);
